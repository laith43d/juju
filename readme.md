## About Juju

Juju is a REST application framework with expressive, elegant structure. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Juju attempts to take the liability of organising the code as much as possible, making it a very easy to start developing your project within minutes, deployment is also very easy, whether you will deploy locally, on Docker, or creating microservices with server deployment, we've got you covered with easy to manage configuration, some of Juju features:

- Simple, fast routing engine.
- Powerful yet easy to use middleware, simply utilize decorators which everyone loves.
- Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
- Expressive, intuitive database ORM called Orator. Although it is ORM agnostic, Orator comes out of the box. PonyORM is available to use out of the box, but it is not activated by default.
- Database agnostic schema migrations (Orator only).
- Robust asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing using Celery.
- Uses Gunicorn server out of the box (feel free to use whatever you like).
- Easy to use command line tool.
- Easy to manage extension deployment.

Juju is extendable, Flask runs at the heart of Juju makes it very easy to benefit from Flask ecosystem. Juju is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
